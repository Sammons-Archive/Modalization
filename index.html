			<h2>A Singular Perspective of The S.E.</h2>
				"In the grand scheme of things, I suppose it is fine to extrapolate the peculiarities of natural anomalies with regard to the widely recognized organism represented by the Software Engineer. After all, the conclusions and solutions we come to will not affect their progress, their innovation, and their software's generally insatiable expansion into every crevasse of our lives. We will all, at one time or another become obsolete in the face of technology - the same technology these <i>people</i> maintain, and indeed, <i>expand</i> - despite the inevitable looming possibility of engineering themselves into obsolescence."
